# MintyDEFI: A second-layer ecosystem for MintME

## Problem

MintME.com uses an order book model despite it's extremely small market size, which means wide bid-ask spreads and very low liquidity, which makes MintME.com grossly inappropriate for day trading, large investors, and short-term investments.

## Solution

We introduced a DeFi exchange to MintME with the hope of solving the biggest problem plaguing the MintME ecosystem. We hope that we can replace MintME.com with a DeFi exchange, since MintME.com have critical design flaws that hurt the market in fundamental ways. We will initially use Uniswap V2, but we have intentions on launching a DEX specially designed for ERC-223 tokens and MintME in the future.

## Roadmap

### Phrase 1 - Completely deploy Uniswap

25/06/2021 - UniswapV2Router3 launch - completed

### I intend to pause development of this project since I have some personal issues and other projects to deal with currently
